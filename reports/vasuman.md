> If you spend 7 days mastering this repository, you can land a 6 figure job in 2026. 
> 
> Throw the GitHub link into Gemini, have it teach you step by step at a high level (to understand terminology and how to use the repository). 
> 
> Clone the repo and walk through it with Cursor/Claude Code, play around with the tutorials and attempt to replicate or test the functionality
> 
> Build using this exact framework and publish what you've built. Add it to your resume, tweet about it, make a YouTube video about it, push it on LinkedIn, etc. 
> 
> Then use that to start a conversation with experts in the AI space and founding teams at AI startups. 
> 
> THIS IS THE FUTURE I SWEAR TO GOD JUST LOOK AT THIS FUCKING REPO. PLEASE. I AM BEGGING YOU.

> The problem with vibe-coding is that it opened the floodgates to a certain kind of person (myself included) who now pushes the idea that you can vibe-code an app in a few days and start printing life changing amounts of money. 
> 
> It’s turning into the same fake and lame energy of the info-guru world where the lifestyle becomes the product by setting unrealistic expectations to lazy people who want to get rich quick. 
> 
> In case I misled people: my belief is you can vibe-code an MVP. You can get interest, a waitlist, even early revenue. If the product is simple or you have basic engineering instincts, sometimes you really can build and scale something meaningful fast. It happens.
> 
> But most of the time building real software still takes months. It needs iteration, debugging, new features, and actual users so you can test and fix. Non-engineers often misunderstand that software is a living, breathing organism. It needs maintenance, it needs oxygen (distribution and growth), and none of that is instant or finitely required. 
> 
> Anyone claiming you can fully automate marketing is lying. Anyone promising thousands of paying users overnight is selling an edge case. These outcomes happen, but they’re rare and treating them as the standard is how people end up disillusioned and angry. 
> 
> A lot of the “software fell off” narrative comes from comparing today to the 2000s/2010s, when (I believe) companies were built with decades in mind. Too many founders now (again, myself included) fantasize about quick wealth instead of lasting impact, largely due to social media and very largely due to every VC jamming the Cursor, Lovable, etc narrative down our throats (see: the fastest company to 100M ARR charts).
> 
> I’m not saying you shouldn’t want to get rich, even quickly. That’s actually exactly what I want to do. I’m saying you may see more success by aiming to build something enduring because the opposite is a very unlikely-to-hit gamble where survivorship bias the only thing you see on your feed. 
> 
> To be completely clear (and TLDR): for selfish reasons alone, you should want to build for long-term impact. Do not let social media convince you that you can no-code a $10M ARR SaaS or raising $50M at 22 and exiting in 2 years are normal.

> Claude Code works because it's the frontier of LLM intelligence with complete access to your computer that can spin off a 100 subagents to solve for a single prompt.
> 
> Use it like you would a mini-you/employee that lives inside your computer and can do anything. Literally ask it anything.
> 
> I know that sounds stupid but I'm saying it this way because everyone still considers Claude Code as a Cursor competitor. It is that but also something more.

> If you have not been using Claude Code because you are satisfied with Cursor - that's fine. Use Claude Code for something else.

> 2. Take that TDD to Cursor and and follow this process, step by step:
> 
> 3. Use Composer 1 to one-shot a step
> 
> 4. Use Claude Opus 4.5 to double-check Composer's work
> 
> 5. [Optional] Use GPT 5.1 Codex High to double check Claude Opus's work
> 
> 6. Test it yourself in localhost
> 
> 7. Move on to the next step
> 
> 8. Finish all steps in the original technical design document, and you're done. Deploy it to Cloudflare for Free.

> Their models are too expensive for their relative intelligence. Their edge in model programming ability is now gone. They are bleeding money, raising prices, and rate limiting their only good models.

> Their last remaining edge, taste, will be slimmer after Gemini-3.0, and whatever is left will not be worth paying 10x for.

> How to win in 2026:
> 
> It’s December 1st. If you wait until the new year to start on your resolutions, your odds of sticking to them are near-zero. The only way you have a shot is if you start now, and let January be a checkpoint instead of a fake reason to start.
> 
> Spend 2 hours today doing this to win. If you can't make 2 hours you're screwed.
> 
> Hour 1: Reflection. Look back on your year and be honest. What went well, what went wrong, What went well, what went wrong, which resolutions you swore you’d keep but abandoned a month in. At what point did you actually stop going to the gym, or writing, or building, and what did you do instead?
> 
> “I forgot" or "I wasn’t motivated" aren't good enough answers. More often it’s something like: you tried to start at a level that didn’t fit your real life, so you failed a few times, felt bad, and then avoided it. Or you just preferred scrolling Instagram over learning Russian, and that's fine too, but you have to admit that to yourself.
> 
> Hour 2: Planning. People tend to mess up here because they think too big. Start so small it almost feels pointless. If you want to run a marathon in 2026, write that down, but make a day-to-day plan where you commit to running 5 minutes a day for the first week, not 3 miles. If you want to read more, set a rule of 5 pages a day, not a book a week. If you want to build something, block off just 30 minutes a day, not 3 hours, where your phone is in another room and you’re only allowed to work on that one thing.
> 
> The point isn’t to impress anyone with how intense your plan looks on paper. In fact, don't tell ANYONE about your goals until you've worked on each one for at least a week. Spare your brain from the dopamine hit that it gets from telling people about your goals. 
> 
> The point is to pick something small enough that you can do it every day without negotiating with yourself. Don't pretend that January 1st has magical powers that December 1st doesn't. Just get started today and build the habits so that when the New Year rolls around, it's just another day at work. 
> 
> Copy and paste this prompt if you want ChatGPT to build this plan with you:
> 
> ======<PROMPT>======
> You are my planning coach.
> 
> We will do this in 2 phases: first dissect this past year, then plan next year. Follow these rules:
> - Ask me ONE question at a time.
> - No pep talks, no long paragraphs.
> - Be specific and practical. Push for clear answers.
> 
> Phase 1: review this year. Ask me:
> 1) What were the biggest wins this year? Ask for concrete examples.
> 2) What were the biggest failures or disappointments? Ask what actually happened.
> 3) Which goals or habits did I drop? Ask when I stopped and what I did instead.
> 4) For each dropped goal, ask me for the most honest reason why I stopped (too big, no time, preferred scrolling, etc.) and challenge vague answers.
> 
> Only move to Phase 2 when you feel you understand my patterns, what makes me tick, and what my motivations are.
> 
> Phase 2: plan next year.
> 1) Ask me for my top 3 goals for next year.
> 2) For each goal, turn it into a tiny daily or weekly habit I can start now. Make it so small it is hard to skip.
> 3) For each habit, ask me:
> - What exact time of day will I do it?
> - What will it be attached to (e.g. after breakfast, before bed)?
> - What environment changes I need (phone in another room, gym clothes laid out, etc.).
> - Ensure that although it starts out small, it progressively overloads over time, so that my bigger goal is eventually reached.
> 4) Challenge anything that sounds unrealistic or vague and force me to make it smaller and more concrete.
> 
> At the end, summarize my plan as:
> - 3 main goals
> - the exact small habits tied to each + how and when to progressively overload each
> - a simple weekly schedule I can screenshot
> ======</PROMPT>======

> The problem with vibe-coding is that it opened the floodgates to a certain kind of person (myself included) who now pushes the idea that you can vibe-code an app in a few days and start printing life changing amounts of money. 
> 
> It’s turning into the same fake and lame energy of the info-guru world where the lifestyle becomes the product by setting unrealistic expectations to lazy people who want to get rich quick. 
> 
> In case I misled people: my belief is you can vibe-code an MVP. You can get interest, a waitlist, even early revenue. If the product is simple or you have basic engineering instincts, sometimes you really can build and scale something meaningful fast. It happens.
> 
> But most of the time building real software still takes months. It needs iteration, debugging, new features, and actual users so you can test and fix. Non-engineers often misunderstand that software is a living, breathing organism. It needs maintenance, it needs oxygen (distribution and growth), and none of that is instant or finitely required. 
> 
> Anyone claiming you can fully automate marketing is lying. Anyone promising thousands of paying users overnight is selling an edge case. These outcomes happen, but they’re rare and treating them as the standard is how people end up disillusioned and angry. 
> 
> A lot of the “software fell off” narrative comes from comparing today to the 2000s/2010s, when (I believe) companies were built with decades in mind. Too many founders now (again, myself included) fantasize about quick wealth instead of lasting impact, largely due to social media and very largely due to every VC jamming the Cursor, Lovable, etc narrative down our throats (see: the fastest company to 100M ARR charts).
> 
> I’m not saying you shouldn’t want to get rich, even quickly. That’s actually exactly what I want to do. I’m saying you may see more success by aiming to build something enduring because the opposite is a very unlikely-to-hit gamble where survivorship bias the only thing you see on your feed. 
> 
> To be completely clear (and TLDR): for selfish reasons alone, you should want to build for long-term impact. Do not let social media convince you that you can no-code a $10M ARR SaaS or raising $50M at 22 and exiting in 2 years are normal.

> A month ago I said I was bearish on Anthropic. People questioned why.

> Their models are too expensive for their relative intelligence. Their edge in model programming ability is now gone. They are bleeding money, raising prices, and rate limiting their only good models.
> 
> Their last remaining edge, taste, will be slimmer after Gemini-3.0, and whatever is left will not be worth paying 10x for. 
> 
> Anthropic is dust. 
> 
> Hence why they are turning more towards regulation, and less towards pushing the boundaries of model capability.

> I built this months ago then realized the winner was GPT every single time.

> Even after plugging in Gemini 3.0, the winner was GPT 5.1, every single time.

> If you still don’t get tool calls, start here:  
> 
> AWS open-sourced a full AgentCore samples repo. It’s one of the more clear and value-driven agents on AWS walkthroughs I’ve seen (linked below, not sponsored). 
> 
> AgentCore = production layer for agents: serverless runtime, safe tool access (Gateway/MCP), identity, memory, and full tracing/observability.   
> 
> Clone it in Cursor and spend 24 hours actually building and learning by playing around with it. 
> 
> Then I’m telling @eyad_khrais to drop a playbook. Follow him + turn on post notifications to make sure you don't miss it. 
> 
> Get to building.
